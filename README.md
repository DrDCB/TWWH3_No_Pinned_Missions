# No Pinned Missions
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. Disables "sticky" notifications on the side of the screen for all campaign missions, including character quest battles. You can still manually toggle them on and off as usual via the mission panel. This mod just stops them automatically being pinned when the quest is first issued.

Note that this replaces more or less the entirety of the missions_tables db table, which may not be great for compatibility. It will also require an update with every new DLC.

Mod originally uploaded to the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2793231337). Releases added here to support other platforms.
